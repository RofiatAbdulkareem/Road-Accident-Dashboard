# Road-Accident-Dashboard
In this analysis, I analyzed a road accident data through 2021 to 2022. I wanted to find answers to the following
1. The monthly and yearly trend at which accidents occur
2. Total accidents, the severity of the accidents
3. No of accident in in different types of road
4. No of death per area and road type
5. Comparing Casualties by different car types
6. Casualties at different speed limits, and the time at which most accidents occur.

I was able to analyze the data set and presented a 2-page interactive dashboard using powerBI.

These are my insights
1. There were more accidents in 2021 compared to 2022
2. The total accidents for the two years was 308,000, and the most occured accident type are accidents that happen slightly
3. The road type also contributed to the No. of accidents and casualties; Single Carriage Way had the highest number of accidents
4. The car type also contributed, small cars (240,000) had higher accidents compared to motorcycle, truck, buses e.t.c
5. Higher speedlimit showed higher number of accidents, The likelyhood of having an accident when the driver drives with a highspeed is high.
6. More accidents occur during the daylight compared to night time or darkness.
